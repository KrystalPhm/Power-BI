## Problem Statement

This dashboard serves as a crucial tool to help the company gain a deeper understanding of their revenue across specific provinces and regions. It provides detailed information on varying levels of revenue in different provinces, thereby aiding the company in identifying which areas contribute significantly to revenue and which ones need improvement.

By analyzing data from different regions and provinces, the company can pinpoint geographical areas that require focused improvement to optimize business performance. This enables them to devise suitable development strategies aimed at enhancing profitability and revenue.

Furthermore, through this dashboard, the company also gains an overview of revenue and profitability levels in each locality. This allows them to analyze and continue researching factors causing declines in profitability, thus enabling them to propose effective remedial measures.
